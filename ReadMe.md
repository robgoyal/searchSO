# searchSO
    
## Purpose

Motivation to create this extension was to learn about using basic front-end web development technologies as well as being more efficient in using searches for Stackoverflow. 

## Procedure

The Chrome extension allows you to perform a generic query for Stackoverflow indicating how many results you'd like and displays them within the extension popup.

These results are similar to the results shown on the stackoverflow search page.

## Usage

Download or clone this repository, open up the Chrome Extensions Settings page, click on Load unpacked extension and point it to the downloaded/cloned directory. 

## Future Modifications

This initial version was to have a fully functional product. A few changes that could be made are proper form validation which there is a major lack of here, changes to CSS which make the extension look better, and provided the option to return results from certain filters (tags, date, answers, etc).
